Every recursion can be implemented using dynamic programming, it just calculate from the base case bottom-up, instead of top-down. It eliminate the overlapping calculation. If there is no overlapping, they are the same.

# Fibonacci
## Recursion
```
fib(n)
  if n = 1 or n = 2
    return 1
  else
    return fib(n-2) + fib(n-1)
```

## Dynamic
```
fib(n)
  arr = [0, 1, 1]
  i = 3
  while i <= n
    arr[i] = arr[i - 2] + arr[i - 1]
    i = i + 1
  return arr[n]
```
