Why... why did you run away?

I just... just want to take your out for a... for a dinner.

You think I need your dinner.

Didn't you hear me? We are done!

I have a boyfriend already.

What are you talking about. You aren't married yet, aren't you?

Tell me where are you going to move, otherwise I can't find you.

Take a hike, it's none of your business. Why do I have to tell you?

Want me to slam you?

That's not good.

Enough! Donâ€™t waste my time anymore.

If you really like to slam me, then do it.

Leave me alone.
